	abstract = {Practical building operations usually deviate from the designed building operational performance due to the wide existence of operating faults and improper control strategies. Great energy saving potential can be realized if inefficient or faulty operations are detected and amended in time. The vast amounts of building operational data collected by the Building Automation System have made it feasible to develop data-driven approaches to anomaly detection. Compared with supervised analytics, unsupervised anomaly detection is more practical in analyzing real-world building operational data, as anomaly labels are typically not available. Autoencoder is a very powerful method for the unsupervised learning of high-level data representations. Recent development in deep learning has endowed autoencoders with even greater capability in analyzing complex, high-dimensional and large-scale data. This study investigates the potential of autoencoders in detecting anomalies in building energy data. An autoencoder-based ensemble method is proposed while providing a comprehensive comparison on different autoencoder types and training schemes. Considering the unique learning mechanism of autoencoders, specific methods have been designed to evaluate the autoencoder performance. The research results can be used as foundation for building professionals to develop advanced tools for anomaly detection and performance benchmarking.},

	abstract = {Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using early fault detection methods can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs before they reach a catastrophic stage. To achieve anomaly detection and fault analysis of wind turbine components, this paper proposes a deep learning method based on a deep auto-encoder (DAE) network using operational supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines. First, a component DAE network model using multiple restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) was constructed. Previously collected normal SCADA data from wind turbines were used to train this multilayer network model layer-wise to extract the relationships between SCADA variables. Then, a reconstruction error (Re) was calculated by using the DAE network input and its output reconstruction value, which was deﬁned as the condition detection index to reﬂect the component health condition. Due to the acute changes and disturbances of wind speed in actual operation, the calculated detection index always has an extreme distribution that can cause false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive threshold determined by the extreme value theory was proposed and used as the rule of anomaly judgement. The method can not only implement early warning of fault components but also deduce the physical location of a faulted component by DAE residuals. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was veriﬁed by some reported failure cases of wind turbine components.},

	abstract = {Rotating machines like engines, pumps, or turbines are ubiquitous in modern day societies. Their mechanical parts such as electrical engines, rotors, or bearings are the major components and any failure in them may result in their total shutdown. Anomaly detection in such critical systems is very important to monitor the system’s health. As the requirement to obtain a dataset from rotating machines where all possible faults are explicitly labeled is difﬁcult to satisfy, we propose a method that focuses on the normal behavior of the machine instead. We propose an autoencoder model-based method for condition monitoring of rotating machines by using an anomaly detection approach. The method learns the characteristics of a rotating machine using the normal vibration signals to model the healthy state of the machine. A threshold-based approach is then applied to the reconstruction error of unseen data, thus enabling the detection of unseen anomalies. The proposed method can directly extract the salient features from raw vibration signals and eliminate the need for manually engineered features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by employing two rotating machine datasets and the quality of the automatically learned features is compared with a set of handcrafted features by training an Isolation Forest model on either of these two sets. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed solution gives promising results, achieving an average F1-score of 99.6\%.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is critical for the reliability and safety of wind turbine. Toward this objective, this paper proposes an anomaly detection scheme for wind turbine using only normal samples. Specifically, a novel nonlinear tool, generalized multiscale Poincare plots (GMPOP), is firstly developed to capture the behavior changes of vibration signals through scales. Subsequently, support vector data description (SVDD) is established to learn the acceptance region defined for anomaly detection from the GMPOP information under normal conditions. The feasibility of GMPOP is initially studied on simulated signals. Further, two datasets, from an experimental bearing and a 2 MW wind turbine, are analyzed to illustrate the evolution process. Comparing to such the state-of-the-art indicators as root mean square, permutation entropy and dispersion entropy, the GMPOP-based method can successfully detect the state anomalies of before the occurrence of the outer race fault and inner race fault, and provide anomaly alarms in advance. The study suggests that the proposed GMPOP is an effective way to assess the dynamical alteration of wind turbine. Moreover, compared with other baselines: autoencoder, principal components analysis, minimum covariance determinant and exponentially weighted moving average control chart, the proposed detection model GMPOP-SVDD produces favorable performance regarding multiple aspects.},

	abstract = {As a critical component, failures of high-speed shaft bearing in wind turbines cause the unplanned stoppage of electrical energy production. Investigations related to naturally progressed defects of high-speed shaft bearings are relatively scarce and the online assessment in damage severities is rarely available in the literature. In this sense, this paper presents a new online vibration-based diagnosis method for wind turbine high-speed bearing monitoring. The adaptive resonance theory 2 (ART2) is proposed for an unsupervised classiﬁcation of the extracted features. The Randall model is adapted considering the geometry of the tested bearing to train the ART2 in the oﬄine step. In fact, the time domain, the frequency domain, and the time-frequency domain are investigated for a better bearing fault characterization. Indeed, the use of real measured data from a wind turbine drivetrain proves that the proposed data-driven approach is suitable for wind turbine bearings online condition monitoring even under real experimental conditions. This method reveals a better generalization capability compared to previous works even with noisy measurements.},

	abstract = {Condition monitoring and failure prediction for wind turbines currently comprise a hot research topic. This follows from the fact that investments in the wind energy sector have increased dramatically due to the transition to renewable energy production. This paper reviews and implements several techniques from state-of-the-art research on condition monitoring for wind turbines using SCADA data and the normal behavior modeling framework. The ﬁrst part of the paper consists of an in-depth overview of the current state of the art. In the second part, several techniques from the overview are implemented and compared using data (SCADA and failure data) from ﬁve operational wind farms. To this end, six demonstration experiments are designed. The ﬁrst ﬁve experiments test different techniques for the modeling of normal behavior. The sixth experiment compares several techniques that can be used for identifying anomalous patterns in the prediction error. The selection of the tested techniques is driven by requirements from industrial partners, e.g., a limited number of training data and low training and maintenance costs of the models. The paper concludes with several directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Wind energy is becoming a common source of renewable energy in the world. Wind turbines are increasing in number, both for onshore and offshore applications. One challenge with wind turbines is in detecting anomalies that cause their breakdown. Due to the complex nature of the wind turbine assembly, it is quite an extensive process to detect causes of malfunctions in the system. This study uses the Mahalanobis distance (MD) to detect anomalies in wind turbine operation, using SCADA alarm data as a comparison. Different predictive models were generated as the bases for analyses in MD computations. Using the SCADA alarm data as a reference, trend patterns that deviated from the threshold value were compared. Results showed that the MD could be used to detect anomalies within a group of data sets, with behaviors learned based on the model used. A large portion of those data sets deviated from the threshold level, corresponding to serious alarms in the SCADA data. We concluded that the MD can detect anomalies in different wind turbine components, based on this study. MD analysis of models can be used in conditions monitoring systems of wind turbines.},
