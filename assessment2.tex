\section{ Research Question (10 marks)}
In large-scale wind farms, how does a CNN autoencoder-based Normal Behaviour Monitoring Model compare to conventional threshold-based monitoring techniques and other normal behavior models (such as long short-term memory) in terms of accuracy and false positive rate for anomaly detection?

\section{Search Query (5 marks)}
Here are queries that I used to search for articles related to the research question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "autoencoder" AND (normal behavior monitoring OR anomaly detection)
    \item "CNN autoencoder for anomaly detection"
    \item "LSTM for wind farm monitoring"
    \item "normal behavior models for wind farm monitoring"
\end{itemize}

\section{Mapping of Articles (15 marks)}
Select four research articles relevant to your research question, ensuring they belong to at least two different categories. Then, create a structured mapping of these articles using a format of your choice. You may present this as a table, a list, or a mind map, whichever best suits you.

\section{Literature Survey (60 marks)}
Write a literature survey based on the five selected articles for your research question. The literature review should be \textbf{1000-1500 words} and should analyze and synthesize the findings from the articles, highlighting key themes, methodologies, and gaps in the existing research.

\section{References (10 marks)}
Ensure proper in-text citations and include a bibliography. You are free to use any recognized citation format (e.g., APA, MLA, Harvard, IEEE), but it must be consistent throughout your article.
